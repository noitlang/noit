**Noit** is a functional programming language with a concurrency model based on light processes and message passing. It features static typing, explicit casting, and immutability. Despite allowing side effects, Noit ensures all values remain immutable. Noit compiles to C, providing both performance and portability while leveraging functional programming principles. Noit is designed to be easy enough to learn that you can learn it in an afternoon.
